                These Terms of Use (these &quot;Terms&quot;) set forth the legally binding terms and conditions that govern your use

                of these Terms, do not access or use the App.

                These Terms require the use of arbitration (Section 10.2) on an individual basis to resolve disputes, rather than
                jury trials or class actions, and also limit the remedies available to you in the event of a dispute.
